# AI-Powered Capture Specification

This specification extends `specs/inbox.md` with AI-native capture and processing capabilities. The goal is frictionless task ingestion from any input modality, with intelligent extraction of structured data.

## Overview

Traditional task capture requires manual field entry. AI-native capture inverts this:
1. User provides unstructured input (text, voice, clipboard, URL)
2. System intelligently extracts and structures task data
3. User confirms or adjusts before saving

This reduces capture friction while improving data quality.

## Input Modalities

### Text Input

Type or paste natural language text to capture a task:

```
Input: "Call mom tomorrow at 3pm about her birthday party"

Extracted:
  title: "Call mom about her birthday party"
  due_date: [tomorrow 15:00]
  suggested_tags: ["@calls", "family"]
```

### Voice Input

Speak naturally to capture a task. The system understands context clues:

```
Voice: "Remind me to pick up the dry cleaning when I'm near downtown"

Extracted:
  title: "Pick up dry cleaning"
  suggested_tags: ["@errands", "downtown"]
  location_trigger: "downtown area"
```

The user can review and edit the extracted information before saving.

### Clipboard/Share Sheet

When you paste or share content, the system intelligently extracts task information:

| Content Type | Extracted As |
|--------------|------------|
| Email | Title from subject, tags from sender, due dates from content |
| URL | Title from page, tags from domain, details from content |
| Calendar invite | Title from event, due date from time, tags from attendees |
| Text or image | Title and details extracted from content |

### Global Launcher (Desktop)

System-wide hotkey (configurable, default: `Cmd+Shift+Space` / `Ctrl+Shift+Space`):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎤 [                                  ] │
│     Type or speak to capture...         │
│                                         │
│  Recent: @work  @home  Project Alpha    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Launcher features:
- Single-line input with AI expansion
- Voice input toggle
- Recent tags/projects for quick assignment
- Keyboard-navigable suggestions
- Escape to dismiss, Enter to capture

### Mobile Quick Capture

- Widget for home screen
- Share sheet extension
- Notification reply action
- Siri/Assistant integration
- Lock screen quick capture (iOS 18+)

## What Gets Extracted

When processing user input, the system extracts and suggests:

**Core Task Information**
- Title: A clear, actionable task title
- Note: Additional details or context

**Date Information**
- Due date from natural language ("tomorrow", "next Tuesday")
- Defer date if mentioned

**Organization**
- Matching project suggestion
- Relevant tag suggestions

**Task Metadata**
- Estimated duration
- Whether task is waiting on someone else

### Understanding Date References

The system understands natural date language:

| Input | Interpreted As |
|-------|--------|
| "tomorrow" | next calendar day |
| "next Tuesday" | next Tuesday |
| "in 3 days" | 3 days from now |
| "end of month" | last day of current month |
| "Q2" | April 1 - June 30 |
| "3pm" | today at 3pm, or tomorrow if in the past |

When ambiguous, the system asks:
```
Input: "meeting on the 15th"

Which month? November 15 or December 15?
[Nov 15] [Dec 15] [Other...]
```

### Project and Tag Suggestions

The system suggests matching projects and tags based on your input:

```
Input: "Fix the login bug for acme project"

Project suggestions:
  - "Acme Corp Website"
  - "Acme Mobile App"

Tag suggestions:
  - "@bugs"
  - "@development"
```

The system shows the most likely matches so you can select or correct them.

### Multiple Tasks

When your input contains multiple tasks, the system separates them:

```
Input: "Need to buy groceries, call the dentist, and finish the report by Friday"

Extracted tasks:
  1. "Buy groceries" (tags: @errands)
  2. "Call the dentist" (tags: @calls)
  3. "Finish the report" (due: Friday)

Prompt: "Create 3 separate tasks?"
```

### Context Enhancement

When you reference calendar events, locations, recent tasks, or external content (emails, URLs), the system can use that context to improve extraction. For example:
- "before my 2pm meeting" automatically extracts the actual meeting time
- "at the store" can match to location-tagged contexts
- Similar past tasks inform duration and project suggestions

## Confirmation UI

AI extraction requires user confirmation to prevent errors:

### Quick Confirm

When the extraction is clear and accurate:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Call mom about her birthday party        │
│   📅 Tomorrow 3:00 PM                       │
│   🏷️ @calls, family                        │
│                                            │
│ [Create Task]  [Edit...]  [Cancel]         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Detailed Review

When you need to verify or adjust the extracted information:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title: [Call mom about her birthday party] │
│                                            │
│ Due:    [Tomorrow    ] [3:00 PM  ]         │
│ Defer:  [None        ]                     │
│ Project:[Inbox       ▼]                    │
│ Tags:   [@calls ×] [family ×] [+]         │
│                                            │
│ ⚠️ Uncertain: Is this the right time?      │
│                                            │
│ [Create Task]              [Cancel]        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Batch Confirm (Multiple Tasks)

When multiple tasks detected:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Create 3 tasks?                            │
│                                            │
│ ☑ Buy groceries (@errands)                 │
│ ☑ Call the dentist (@calls)                │
│ ☑ Finish the report (due: Friday)          │
│                                            │
│ [Create All]  [Create Selected]  [Cancel]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Smart Duplicate Detection

Before creating a task, the system checks for potential duplicates and presents options to the user. When a similar task is found, you can decide to update the existing task or create a new one.

UI for duplicates:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Similar task exists:                    │
│                                            │
│ Existing: "Call mom" (created yesterday)   │
│ New:      "Call mom about birthday"        │
│                                            │
│ [Update Existing]  [Create New]  [Cancel]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
