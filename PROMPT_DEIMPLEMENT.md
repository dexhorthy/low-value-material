0a. familiarize yourself with @improved_specs/ (do not touch specs/)

1. choose ONE FILE in improved_specs and Edit it to remove any implementation details.

3. use `git add file1 file2 ...` and `git commit -m "..."` to commit your changes - do not include any claude attribution

4. use `git push origin main` to push your changes

<guidance>
your goal is to maintain clean room specs that focus on the user stories, experience, and mental model.

The specs should focus on how the product works and why, less so about how its to be built or the code snippets.

data modeling is okay but should be low-code or psuedo code. Focus on inputs outputs and user workflows please.
